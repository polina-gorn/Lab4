# Lab4
This website was created as part of Lab4 for GGR472 to explore Turf.js library to integrate GIS analysis into web maps.

This website visualizes the data on vehicle collisions with cyclists or pedestrian taken from the City of Toronto Open Data: https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/motor-vehicle-collisions-involving-killed-or-seriously-injured-persons/
